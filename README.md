# jcovr

Visualization tool for Concolic Line Coverage based on [gcovr HTML][gcovr github].

Refer to the publication [*Towards Quantification and Visualization of the Effects of Concretization during Concolic Testing*](https://doi.org/10.1109/LES.2022.3171603) for more details.

# Build

Clone this repository and run:

	$ go build -trimpath

This will create a statically linked `./jcovr` binary.

# Usage

The `jcovr` binary expects to receive an arbitrary number file paths to
`gcov` JSON files (see `--json-format` option in `gcov(1)`) as command-line
arguments. These files should be generated by [coverage-vp][coverage-vp github].
For each given json file an HTML page is generated, furthermore an
overview page is also generated by `jcovr`. These HTML pages visualize
Concolic Line Coverage (CLC) information generated by coverage-vp as
described in the IEEE Embedded System Letters (ESL) journal publication
*Towards Quantification and Visualization of the Effects of
Concretization during Concolic Testing*.
